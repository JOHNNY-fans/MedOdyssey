Colon Cancer
Discussion
Terminologies in all NCCN Guidelines are being actively modified to advance the goals of equity, inclusion, and representation.
Updates in Version 1.2024 of the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer from Version 4.2023 include:
General
• POLE/POLD1 mutation added to dMMR/MSI-H description/header for metastatic disease throughout
• Ablation changed to 'thermal ablation' throughout
COL-2
• Suspected or proven metastatic adenocarcinoma
Workup
◊ Molecular testing language modified: Determination of tumor gene status for RAS and BRAF mutations and HER2 amplifications (individually or
as part of tissue- or blood-based next-generation sequencing [NGS] panel), Determination of tumor (MMR) or (MSI) status (if not previously done)
Molecular testing, including:
– RAS and BRAF mutations; HER2 amplifications; MMR or MSI status (if not previously done)
– Testing should be conducted as part of broad molecular profiling, which would identify rare and actionable mutations and fusions such as POLE/
POLD1, RET, and NTRK.
Footnote m modified: If known RAS/RAF mutation, HER2 testing is not indicated. Tissue- or blood-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels
have the ability to pick up rare and actionable mutations and fusions.
COL-4
• Footnote u modified: Circulating tumor (ctDNA) is emerging as a prognostic marker; however, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend
routine use of ctDNA assays outside of a clinical trial. (Also for COL-8)
COL-7
• Footnote gg added: Patients with BRAF mutations other than V600E may be considered for anti-EGFR therapy. (Also for COL-11, COL-D 4 of 11)
COL-8
• Surveillance, Stage IV
Footnote added to colonoscopy: In patients with stage IV disease managed nonoperatively with complete clinical response, initiate colonoscopy
surveillance from first documentation of complete response.
COL-9
• Footnote mm modified: ...If known RAS/RAF mutation, HER2 testing is not indicated. Determination of tumor MMR or MSI status (if not previously
done)....
COL-11
• pMMR/MSS, Unresectable Metachronous Metastases
Initial Treatment
◊ Qualifier removed/updated: (cetuximab or panitumumab) (KRAS/NRAS/BRAF WT and left-sided tumors only) (Also for COL-D 5 through 7 of 11)
◊ RAS and BRAF WT qualifier removed and updated to HER2- amplified only for fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki
◊ Footnote removed: Cetuximab or panitumumab should only be used for left-sided tumors The panel defines the left side of the colon as splenic
flexure to rectum. Evidence suggests that patients with tumors originating on the right side of the colon (hepatic flexure through cecum) are unlikely
to respond to cetuximab and panitumumab. Data on the response to cetuximab and panitumumab in patients with primary tumors originating in the
transverse colon (hepatic flexure to splenic flexure) are lacking.

Updates in Version 1.2024 of the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer from Version 4.2023 include:
COL-13
• Pathologic Stage modified: Tis; T1–4a, N0, M0 (stage 0–IIB)
• Pathologic Stage added: T4b, N0, M0 (stage IIC)
Adjuvant Treatment added for T4b, N0, M0 (stage IIC): Observation or Consider adjuvant chemotherapy as for low-risk stage III disease
COL-14
• Footnote uu modified: Patients with dMMR/MSI-H or POLE/POLD1 mutation disease who are not candidates for immunotherapy should be treated as
recommended for pMMR/MSS disease. (Also for COL-15)
COL-15
• Text modified: Previous immunotherapy or contraindication
COL-B 4 of 10
• Principles of Pathologic and Molecular Review
Methods of Testing
◊ Bullet added: Repeat molecular testing should not be performed after standard cytotoxic chemotherapy as significant molecular changes are rarely
observed. Changes in the molecular profile can more commonly be seen after targeted therapies and repeat testing may be considered to guide
future targeted therapy decisions.
KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF Mutation Testing
◊ Bullet 1 modified: All patients with metastatic CRC should have tumor genotyped for RAS (KRAS and NRAS) and BRAF mutations individually or as
part of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel (preferred).
COL-B 5 of 10
• HER2 Testing
Bullet 3 revised: Anti-HER2 therapy with signal transduction inhibition (eg, trastuzumab/pertuzumab, trastuzumab/tucatinib, trastuzumab/lapatinib) is
only indicated in HER2-amplified tumors that are also RAS and BRAF wild-type.
COL-B 6 of 10
• New page added with information on POLE/POLD1 mutations and RET fusions
COL-B 10 of 10
• References have been updated.
COL-D 1 of 11
• Initial Therapy
Header modified: pMMR/MSS (or dMMR/MSI-H or POLE/POLD1 mutation that is ineligible for or progression progressed on checkpoint inhibitor
immunotherapy) (Also for COL-D 2 of 11)
COL-D 2 of 11
• The subsequent systemic therapy algorithms have been extensively revised and updated to a table format.
Second-Line and Subsequent Therapy Options (if not previously given)
◊ Previous therapy without oxaliplatin or irinotecan
– Regimens added: If KRAS/NRAS/BRAF WT:
▪ FOLFIRI + (cetuximab or panitumumab)
▪ (Cetuximab or panitumumab) ± irinotecan
◊ 'Left-sided' removed from KRAS/NRAS/BRAF WT qualifier

Updates in Version 1.2024 of the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer from Version 4.2023 include:
COL-D 4 of 11
• Footnotes
Footnote g modified: Cetuximab or panitumumab should only be used for left-sided tumors. The panel defines the left side of the colon as splenic
flexure to rectum. Evidence suggests that patients with tumors originating on the right side of the colon (hepatic flexure through cecum) are unlikely to
respond to cetuximab and panitumumab in first-line therapy for metastatic disease.
Footnote h added: Patients with BRAF mutations other than V600E may be considered for anti-EGFR therapy.
Footnotes removed:
◊ Larotrectinib or entrectinib are treatment options for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that is NTRK gene fusion-positive. Selpercatinib is a
treatment option for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that is RET gene fusion-positive.
◊ Fruquintinib or regorafenib or trifluridine + tipiracil with or without bevacizumab are treatment options for patients who have progressed through all
available regimens.
◊ If not previously given.
◊ Nivolumab ± ipilimumab are FDA approved for colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and
irinotecan. However, a number of patients in the clinical trials had not received all three prior systemic therapies. Thirty-seven percent of patients
received nivolumab monotherapy and 24% received ipilimumab/nivolumab combination therapy in first- or second-line, and 28% and 31% of
patients had not received all three indicated prior therapies before treatment with nivolumab or ipilimumab/nivolumab, respectively.
COL-D 5 of 11
• Regimen and dosing added for:
CAPEOX + cetuximab
CAPEOX + panitumumab
COL-D 8 of 11
• Regimen qualifiers modified for the following:
Pembrolizumab (dMMR/MSI-H only or POLE/POLD1 mutation)
Nivolumab (dMMR/MSI-H only or POLE/POLD1 mutation)
Nivolumab + ipilimumab (dMMR/MSI-H only or POLE/POLD1 mutation)
Dostarlimab-gxly (dMMR/MSI-H only or POLE/POLD1 mutation)
Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (HER2-amplified)
• Dose modified for fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki: 6.4 5.4 mg/kg IV on day 1, Repeat every 21 days
COL-D 11 of 11
• References have been updated.
COL-E 1 of 2
• Principles of Radiation and Chemoradiation Therapy
General Principles; Regimen language modified for:
◊ Infusional 5-FU + RT: 5-FU 225 mg/m2 IV over 24 hours 5 or 7 days/week during RT daily on days 1–5 or days 1–7 for 5 weeks with RT
◊ Capecitabine + RT: Capecitabine 825 mg/m2 PO twice daily 5 days/week during RT BID, Monday–Friday on days of radiation treatment only,
throughout the duration of RT (typically 28–30 treatment days)
Treatment Information
◊ Target volumes, dose modified: Small bowel dose should be limited to 50 Gy, V45 Gy should be <195 cc for a bowel bag avoidance, or V15 should
be <120 cc for individual small bowel loops, if possible.

r High-risk factors for recurrence (exclusive of those cancers that are MSI-H): poorly differentiated/undifferentiated histology; lymphatic/vascular invasion; bowel obstruction; <12 lymph
nodes examined; perineural invasion (PNI); localized perforation; close, indeterminate, positive margins; or high-tier tumor budding. In patients with high-risk, stage II disease, there are
no data that correlate risk features and selection of chemotherapy.
s There are insufficient data to recommend the use of multi-gene assay panels to determine adjuvant therapy.
t While non-inferiority of 3 mo vs. 6 mo of CAPEOX has not been proven, 3 mo of CAPEOX numerically appeared similar to 6 mo of CAPEOX for 5-year overall survival (82.1% vs. 81.2%;
hazard ratio [HR], 0.96), with considerably less toxicity (Andre T, et al. Lancet Oncol 2020;21:1620-1629). These results support the use of 3 mo of adjuvant CAPEOX over 6 mo in the
vast majority of patients with stage III colon cancer. In patients with colon cancer, staged as T1–3, N1 (low-risk stage III), 3 mo of CAPEOX is non-inferior to 6 mo for disease-free survival

6 mo for DFS, whereas non-inferiority of 3 mo vs. 6 mo of CAPEOX has not been proven. Grade 3+ neurotoxicity rates are lower for patients who receive 3 mo vs. 6 mo of treatment (3%

Initial Workup/Staging
• C/A/P CT
Evaluate local extent of tumor or infiltration into surrounding structures.
Assess for distant metastatic disease to lungs, thoracic and abdominal lymph nodes, liver, peritoneal cavity, and other organs.
CT should be performed with intravenous iodinated contrast and oral contrast material unless contraindicated.
Intravenous contrast is not required for the chest CT (but usually given if performed with abdominal CT scan).
If IV iodinated contrast material is contraindicated because of significant contrast allergy, then MRI examination of the abdomen and pelvis
with IV gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) can be obtained instead. In patients with chronic renal failure (glomerular filtration rate
[GFR] <30 mL/min) who are not on dialysis, IV iodinated contrast material is also contraindicated, and IV GBCA can be administered in
select cases using gadofosveset trisodium, gadoxetate disodium, gadobenate dimeglumine, or gadoteridol.
If iodinated and gadolinium contrast are both contraindicated due to significant allergy or chronic renal failure without dialysis, then
consider MRI without IV contrast or consider FDG-PET/CT imaging.
• Consider an abdomen/pelvis MRI to assist with the diagnosis of rectal cancer versus colon cancer (eg, low-lying sigmoid tumor). The rectum
lies below a virtual line from the sacral promontory to the upper edge of the symphysis as determined by MRI.
• Consider MRI of liver for liver metastases if potentially resectable.
• FDG-PET/CT is not routinely indicated.
FDG-PET/CT does not supplant a contrast-enhanced diagnostic CT or MRI and should only be used to evaluate an equivocal finding on a
contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan or in patients with strong contraindications to IV contrast administration.
Consider FDG-PET/CT (skull base to mid-thigh)
◊ If potentially surgically curable M1 disease in selected cases.
◊ In selected patients considered for image-guided liver-directed therapies (ie, thermal ablation, radioembolization).4-8
• If liver-directed therapy or surgery is contemplated, a hepatic MRI with intravenous routine extracellular or hepatobiliary GBCA is preferred
over CT to assess exact number and distribution of metastatic foci for local treatment planning.
Monitoring
• C/A/P CT with contrast
Prior to adjuvant treatment to assess response to primary therapy or resection
During re-evaluation of conversion to resectable disease
• FDG-PET/CT can be considered for assessment of response and liver recurrence after image-guided liver-directed therapies (ie, thermal
ablation, radioembolization).

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC AND MOLECULAR REVIEW
Endoscopically Removed Malignant Polyps
• A malignant polyp is defined as one with cancer invading through the muscularis mucosa and into the submucosa (pT1). pTis is not
considered a “malignant polyp.”
• Favorable histologic features: grade 1 or 2 (low-grade histology according to WHO 2019), no angiolymphatic invasion, and negative margin
of resection. There is no consensus as to the definition of what constitutes a positive margin of resection. A positive margin has been
defined as: 1) tumor <1 mm from the transected margin; 2) tumor <2 mm from the transected margin; and 3) tumor cells present within the
diathermy of the transected margin.1-4
• Unfavorable histologic features: grade 3 or 4 (high-grade histology according to WHO 2019), angiolymphatic invasion, or a “positive margin.”
See the positive margin definition above. In several studies, high tumor budding has been shown to be an adverse histologic feature
associated with adverse outcome and may preclude polypectomy as an adequate treatment of endoscopically removed malignant polyps.
• There is controversy as to whether malignant colorectal polyps with a sessile configuration can be successfully treated by endoscopic
removal. The literature seems to indicate that endoscopically removed sessile malignant polyps have a significantly greater incidence of
adverse outcomes (residual disease, recurrent disease, mortality, and hematogenous metastasis, but not lymph node metastasis) than do
pedunculated malignant polyps. However, when one looks closely at the data, configuration by itself is not a significant variable for adverse
outcome, and endoscopically removed malignant sessile polyps with grade I or II histology, negative margins, and no lymphovascular
invasion can be successfully treated with endoscopic polypectomy.3-7

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC AND MOLECULAR REVIEW
Pathologic Stage (continued)
• Radial (circumferential) margin evaluation - The serosal surface (peritoneal) does not constitute a surgical margin. In colon cancer the
circumferential (radial) margin represents the adventitial soft tissue closest to the deepest penetration of tumor, and is created surgically
by blunt or sharp dissection of the retroperitoneal aspect. The radial margins should be assessed in all colonic segments with non-
peritonealized surfaces. The circumferential resection margin corresponds to any aspect of the colon that is not covered by a serosal layer
of mesothelial cells, and must be dissected from the retroperitoneum to remove the viscus. On pathologic examination it is difficult to
appreciate the demarcation between a peritonealized surface and non-peritonealized surface. Therefore, the surgeon is encouraged to mark
the area of non-peritonealized surface with a clip or suture. The mesenteric resection margin is the only relevant circumferential margin in
segments completely encased by the peritoneum.10,11
• PNI - The presence of PNI is associated with a significantly worse prognosis. In multivariate analysis, PNI has been shown to be an
independent prognostic factor for cancer-specific, overall, and disease-free survival (DFS). For stage II carcinoma, those with PNI have a
significantly worse 5-year DFS compared to those without PNI (29% vs. 82%; P = .0005).12-14
• Tumor deposits - Irregular discrete tumor deposits in pericolic or perirectal fat away from the leading edge of the tumor and showing no
evidence of residual lymph node tissue, but within the lymphatic drainage of the primary carcinoma, are considered peritumoral deposits or
satellite nodules and are not counted as lymph nodes replaced by tumor. Most examples are due to lymphovascular invasion or, more rarely,
PNI. Because these tumor deposits are associated with reduced DFS and overall survival, their number should be recorded in the surgical
pathology report. This poorer outcome has also been noted in patients with stage III carcinoma.15-18
• High tumor budding - In recent years, high tumor budding has been identified as a new prognostic factor in colon cancer. Recently, there
was an international consensus conference on tumor budding reporting.19 A tumor bud is defined as a single cell or a cluster of ≤4 cells
detected by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) at the advancing edge of the invasive carcinoma. The total number of buds should be reported
from a selected hot spot measuring 0.785 mm (20x ocular in most microscopes/via a conversion factor). Budding is separated into three
tiers: low tier (0–4 buds), intermediate tier (5–9 buds), and high tier (10 or more buds). Two recent studies20,21 using this scoring system
have shown tumor budding to be an independent prognostic factor for stage II colon cancer. An ASCO guideline for stage II colon cancer
designates tumor budding as an adverse (high-risk) factor.22 Several studies have shown that high-tier tumor budding in pT1 colorectal
cancers (CRCs), including malignant polyps, is associated with an increased risk of lymph node metastasis; however, methodologies for
assessing tumor budding and tier were not uniform.23-27

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC AND MOLECULAR REVIEW
Lymph Node Evaluation
• The AJCC and College of American Pathologists recommend examination of a minimum of 12 lymph nodes to accurately stage colon
cancers.8,9,28 The literature lacks consensus as to what is the minimum number of lymph nodes to accurately identify stage II
cancer. The minimum number of nodes has been reported as >7, >9, >13, >20, and >30.29-37 The number of lymph nodes retrieved can vary
with patient age, gender, tumor grade, and tumor site.30 For stage II (pN0) colon cancer, if fewer than 12 lymph nodes are initially identified,
it is recommended that the pathologist go back to the specimen and resubmit more tissue of potential lymph nodes. If 12 lymph nodes
are still not identified, a comment in the report should indicate that an extensive search for lymph nodes was undertaken. The pathologist
should attempt to retrieve as many lymph nodes as possible. It has been shown that the number of negative lymph nodes is an independent
prognostic factor for patients with stage IIIB and IIIC colon cancer.38
Sentinel Lymph Node and Detection of Micrometastasis by Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
• Examination of the lymph nodes (sentinel or routine) by intense histologic and/or immunohistochemical investigation helps to detect the
presence of metastatic disease. The detection of single cells by IHC or by multiple H&E levels and/or clumps of tumor cells <0.2 mm are
considered isolated tumor cells (pN0). The 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual and Handbook39 defines clumps of tumor cells
≥0.2 mm but ≤2 mm in diameter or clusters of 10 to 20 tumor cells as micrometastasis and recommends that these micrometastases be
considered as standard positive lymph nodes (pN+).
• At the present time the use of sentinel lymph nodes and detection of isolated tumor cells by IHC alone should be considered investigational,
and results should be used with caution in clinical management decisions.40-49 Some studies have shown that the detection of IHC
cytokeratin-positive cells in stage II (N0) colon cancer (defined by H&E) has a worse prognosis, while others have not shown this survival
difference. In some of these studies, what are presently defined as isolated tumor cells were considered to be micrometastases.45-50 A recent
meta-analysis51 demonstrated that micrometastases (≥0.2 mm) are a significant poor prognostic factor. However, another recent multicenter
prospective study of stage I or II disease (via H&E) had a 10% decrease in survival for IHC-detected isolated tumor cells, (<0.2 mm) but only
in those with pT3–pT4 disease.52

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC AND MOLECULAR REVIEW
Methods of Testing
• The testing can be performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (preferred) or blood-based assay.
• Repeat molecular testing should not be performed after standard cytotoxic chemotherapy as significant molecular changes are rarely
observed. Changes in the molecular profile can more commonly be seen after targeted therapies and repeat testing may be considered to
guide future targeted therapy decisions.
KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF Mutation Testing
• All patients with metastatic CRC should have tumor genotyped for RAS (KRAS and NRAS) and BRAF mutations individually or as part
of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel (preferred). Patients with any known KRAS mutation (exons 2, 3, and 4) or NRAS mutation
(exons 2, 3, and 4) should not be treated with either cetuximab or panitumumab, unless given as part of a regimen targeting a KRAS G12C
mutation.53-55 BRAF V600E mutation makes response to panitumumab or cetuximab highly unlikely unless given with a BRAF inhibitor.56-58
• BRAF V600E mutation testing via IHC is also an option.
• Testing for KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations should be performed only in laboratories that are certified under the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high-complexity clinical laboratory (molecular pathology) testing. No
specific methodology is recommended (eg, sequencing, hybridization).
• The testing can be performed on the primary CRCs and/or the metastasis, as literature has shown that the KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF
mutations are similar in both specimen types.59
Microsatellite Instability or Mismatch Repair Testing
• Universal MMRa or MSIa testing is recommended in all newly diagnosed patients with colon cancer. See NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/
Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal.
• The presence of a BRAF V600E mutation in the setting of MLH1 absence would preclude the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome (LS) in the vast
majority of patients. However, approximately 1% of cancers with BRAF V600E mutations (and loss of MLH1) are LS. Caution should be
exercised in excluding patients with a strong family history from germline screening in the case of BRAF V600E mutations.60
• Stage II (MSI-H) cancers may have a good prognosis and do not benefit from 5-FU adjuvant therapy.61
• MMR or MSI testing should be performed only in CLIA-approved laboratories.
• Testing for MSI may be accomplished by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or a validated NGS panel, the latter especially in patients with
metastatic disease who require genotyping of RAS and BRAF.
• IHC refers to staining tumor tissue for protein expression of the four MMR genes known to be mutated in LS (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and
PMS2). A normal IHC test implies that all four MMR proteins are normally expressed (retained). Loss (absence) of expression of one or more
of the four DNA MMR proteins is often reported as abnormal or positive IHC. When IHC is reported as positive, caution should be taken to
ensure that positive refers to absence of mismatch expression and not presence of expression. NOTE: Normal is the presence of positive
protein staining (retained/intact) and abnormal is negative or loss of staining of protein. Loss of protein expression by IHC in any one of the
MMR genes guides further genetic testing (mutation detection to the genes where the protein expression is not observed). Abnormal MLH1
IHC should be followed by tumor testing for BRAF V600E mutation or MLH1 promoter methylation. The presence of BRAF V600E mutation or
MLH1 promoter methylation is consistent with sporadic cancer. However, caution should be exercised in excluding patients from germline
screening based on BRAF V600E mutations in the setting of a strong family history.60

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC AND MOLECULAR REVIEW
HER2 Testing
• Diagnostic testing is via IHC, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or NGS.
• Positive by IHC is defined as: 3+ staining in more than 50% of tumor cells. 3+ staining is defined as an intense membrane staining that can
be circumferential, basolateral, or lateral. Those who have a HER2 score of 2+ should be reflexed to FISH testing.62-64 HER2 amplification by
FISH is considered positive when the HER2:CEP17 ratio is ≥2 in more than 50% of the cells.62-64 NGS is another methodology for testing for
HER2 amplification.65
• Anti-HER2 therapy with signal transduction inhibition (eg, trastuzumab/pertuzumab, trastuzumab/tucatinib, trastuzumab/lapatinib) is only
indicated in HER2-amplified tumors that are also RAS and BRAF wild-type.
NTRK Fusions
• NTRK fusions are extremely rare in CRCs.66 The overall incidence is approximately 0.35% in a cohort of 2314 CRCs, with NTRK fusions
confined to those tumors that are pan–wild-type KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF. In one study of 8 CRCs harboring NTRK fusions, 7 were found in
the small subset that were dMMR (MLH-1)/MSI-H.67 NTRK fusions are more frequently found among patients with dMMR.
• NTRK inhibitors have been shown to have activity ONLY in those cases with NTRK fusions, and NOT with NTRK point mutations.
• Methodologies for detecting NTRK fusions are IHC,68 FISH, DNA-based NGS, and RNA-based NGS.66,69 In one study, DNA-based sequencing
showed an overall sensitivity and specificity of 81.1% and 99.9%, respectively, for detection of NTRK fusions when compared to RNA-
based sequencing and IHC showed an overall sensitivity of 87.9% and specificity of 81.1%. Since approximately 1 in 5 tumors identified
as having an NTRK fusion by IHC will be a false positive, tumors that test positive by IHC should be confirmed by RNA NGS. That same
study commented that RNA-based sequencing appears to be the optimal way to approach NTRK fusions, because the splicing out of
introns simplifies the technical requirements of adequate coverage and because detection of RNA-level fusions provides direct evidence
of functional transcription.69 However, selection of the appropriate assay for NTRK fusion detection depends on tumor type and genes
involved, as well as consideration of other factors such as available material, accessibility of various clinical assays, and whether
comprehensive genomic testing is needed concurrently.69

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC AND MOLECULAR REVIEW
POLE/POLD1
• Polymerase genes, POLE and POLD1, encode proteins tasked with proofreading functions to recognize and correct mispaired bases
incorporated during DNA replication. Pathogenic variants (PVs) within the exonuclease domains (ED) of POLE and POLD1 result in loss of
this proofreading function leading to subsequent acquisition of numerous single nucleotide variants (SNVs).70,71
• Germline PVs within the ED of POLE and POLD1 predispose patients to multiple colorectal adenomas and carcinomas, resulting in
polymerase proofreading-associated polyposis (PPAP)70,71 (see NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal).
• Somatic POLE PVs occur in approximately 2%–8% of patients with predominately MSS/pMMR CRC while somatic POLD1 PVs are extremely
rare.70,72
• NGS of CRCs arising in patients with either germline or somatic ED PVs demonstrate an ultramutator phenotype identified as extremely
high tumor mutational burden (TMB >100 mut/Mb). TMB is calculated as the total number of somatic mutations per coding area of the tumor
genome. Although calculations vary according to assay performed, TMB >10 mut/Mb is generally regarded as TMB-high (TMB-H).72,73
• POLE/POLD1 PVs can be identified through single gene assays (PCR or Sanger sequencing). However, TMB calculation requires a larger
NGS panel, which often includes concurrent POLE/POLD1 sequencing. As such, performing a large NGS assay on CRC tumor tissue has
the advantage of not only identifying POLE/POLD1 PVs but also provides direct evidence of loss of proofreading function (TMB-H).72-74
• Patients with CRC harboring POLE/POLD1 PVs have a more favorable prognosis, likely secondary to immune responses stimulated by the
presence of numerous neoantigens produced as a consequence of aberrant proofreading function. Similarly, for these patients disease
responds well to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.74-79
RET Fusions
• RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of neural and genitourinary tissues,
primarily through downstream MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways.80
• Germline activating mutations in RET lead to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) (see NCCN Guidelines for Neuroendocrine and
Adrenal Tumors) and loss of function mutations are associated with Hirschsprung disease and congenital abnormalities of the kidney and
urinary tract.80
• Somatic activating alterations in RET include point mutations as well as gene rearrangements and have been identified in a variety of
tumors.80-82
• In patients with CRC, activating RET fusions involving the C-terminal kinase domain lead to constitutive upregulation of RET kinase activity
and subsequent promotion of cell proliferation and survival. The most common gene fusion partners reported include KIF5B, CCDC6, and
NCOA4.80-83
• The RET-targeted inhibitor, selpercatinib, is FDA-approved for patients with solid tumors harboring activating RET fusions.84
• The presence of RET fusions can be interrogated through a variety of techniques, including IHC, FISH, PCR, and either DNA- or RNA-based
NGS assays. RNA-based NGS assays are fusion agnostic and as such have the advantage of identifying RET fusions involving any partner
gene.81-83

Colectomy
• Lymphadenectomy
Lymph nodes at the origin of feeding vessel(s) should be identified for pathologic examination.
Clinically positive lymph nodes outside the field of resection that are considered suspicious should be biopsied or removed, if possible.
Positive nodes left behind indicate an incomplete (R2) resection.
A minimum of 12 lymph nodes need to be examined to establish N stage.1
• Minimally invasive approaches may be considered based on the following criteria2:
The surgeon has experience performing laparoscopically assisted colorectal operations.3,4
Minimally invasive approaches are generally not indicated for locally advanced cancer or acute bowel obstruction or perforation from
cancer.
Thorough abdominal exploration is required.5
Consider preoperative marking of lesion(s).
• Care of patients with carrier status of known or clinically suspected LS:
Consider more extensive colectomy for patients with a strong family history of colon cancer or young age (<50 y).
See NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal.

SYSTEMIC THERAPY FOR ADVANCED OR METASTATIC DISEASE – FOOTNOTES
a For chemotherapy references, see Chemotherapy Regimens and References (COL-D [5 of 11]).
b For infection risk, monitoring, and prophylaxis recommendations for targeted therapies, see INF-A in the NCCN Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Cancer-
Related Infections.
c C/A/P CT with contrast or chest CT and abdomen/pelvis MRI with contrast to monitor progress of therapy. FDG-PET/CT should not be used. See Principles of Imaging
(COL-A).
d Discontinuation of oxaliplatin should be strongly considered after 3 to 4 months of therapy (or sooner for unacceptable neurotoxicity) while maintaining other agents
until time of progression. Oxaliplatin may be reintroduced if it was discontinued for neurotoxicity rather than for disease progression.
e An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for bevacizumab.
f Principles of Pathologic Review (COL-B 4 of 10).
g The panel defines the left side of the colon as splenic flexure to rectum. Evidence suggests that patients with tumors originating on the right side of the colon (hepatic
flexure through cecum) are unlikely to respond to cetuximab and panitumumab in first-line therapy for metastatic disease. Data on the response to cetuximab and
panitumumab in patients with primary tumors originating in the transverse colon (hepatic flexure to splenic flexure) are lacking.
h Patients with BRAF mutations other than V600E may be considered for anti-EGFR therapy.
i Irinotecan should be used with caution in patients with Gilbert syndrome or elevated serum bilirubin. There is a commercially available test for UGT1A1. Guidelines for
use in clinical practice have not been established.
j FOLFIRINOX should be strongly considered for patients with excellent performance status.
k FOLFIRINOX is recommended instead of FOLFOXIRI because FOLFOXIRI uses a high dose of 5-FU (3,200 mg/m² over 48 hours). Patients in the United States have
been shown to have greater toxicity with 5-FU. The dose of 5-FU (2,400 mg/m² over 46 hours) is a starting dose consistent with the dose recommended in FOLFOX or
FOLFIRI and should be strongly considered for U.S. patients.
l An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for trastuzumab.
m If no previous treatment with HER2 inhibitor.
n The use of single-agent capecitabine after progression on a fluoropyrimidine-containing regimen has been shown to be ineffective; therefore, this is not recommended.
o Arterially directed catheter therapy, and in particular yttrium-90 microsphere selective internal radiation, is an option in highly selected patients with chemotherapy-
resistant/-refractory disease and with predominant hepatic metastases. See Principles of Surgery (COL-C).
p If patients had therapy stopped for reasons other than progression (eg, cumulative toxicity, elective treatment break, patient preference), rechallenge is an option at
time of progression.
q Bevacizumab is the preferred anti-angiogenic agent based on toxicity and/or cost.
r There are no data to suggest activity of FOLFIRI-ziv-aflibercept or FOLFIRI-ramucirumab in a patient who has progressed on FOLFIRI-bevacizumab, or vice versa. Ziv-
aflibercept and ramucirumab have only shown activity when given in conjunction with FOLFIRI in FOLFIRI-naïve patients.
s Cetuximab or panitumumab are recommended in combination with irinotecan-based therapy or as single-agent therapy for patients who cannot tolerate irinotecan.
t In the second-line setting for BRAF V600E mutation-positive tumors, there is phase 3 evidence for better efficacy with targeted therapies over FOLFIRI.
u Some activity was seen after a previous HER2-targeted regimen. May not be indicated in patients with underlying lung issues due to lung toxicity (2.6% report of
deaths from interstitial lung disease).
v If patient is unable to tolerate EGFR inhibitor due to toxicity, single-agent adagrasib or sotorasib can be considered.
w Checkpoint inhibitor therapy options include: nivolumab ± ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, or dostarlimab-gxly. Nivolumab + ipilimumab combination is category 2B when
intensive therapy is not recommended due to toxicity concerns.
x NCCN Guidelines for Management of Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities.
y If disease response, consider discontinuing checkpoint inhibitor after 2 years of treatment.

e An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for bevacizumab.
bb Bevacizumab may be safely given at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/min (5 mg/kg over 10 minutes and 7.5 mg/kg over 15 minutes).
cc The majority of safety and efficacy data for this regimen have been developed in Europe, where a capecitabine starting dose of 1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 14
days, repeated every 21 days, is standard. Evidence suggests that North American patients may experience greater toxicity with capecitabine (as well as with other
fluoropyrimidines) than European patients, and may require a lower dose of capecitabine.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION AND CHEMORADIATION THERAPY
General Principles
• Neoadjuvant RT with concurrent fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy may be considered for initially unresectable or medically inoperable
non-metastatic T4 colon cancer to aid resectability.
Infusional 5-FU + RT1
5-FU 225 mg/m2 IV over 24 hours on days 1–5 or days 1–7 for 5 weeks with RT
Capecitabine + RT2,3
Capecitabine 825 mg/m2 PO BID, Monday–Friday on days of radiation treatment only, throughout the duration of RT (typically 28–30
treatment days)
Bolus 5-FU/leucovorin + RT1,a
5-FU 400 mg/m2 IV bolus + leucovorin 20 mg/m2 IV bolus for 4 days during weeks 1 and 5 of RT
• In patients with a limited number of liver or lung metastases, ablative radiotherapy to the metastatic site can be considered in highly
selected cases or in the setting of a clinical trial. Radiotherapy should not be used in the place of surgical resection. Radiotherapy should be
delivered in a highly conformal manner. The techniques can include 3D conformal RT, intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), or stereotactic body
RT (SBRT).
Treatment Information
• IMRT is preferred for unique clinical situations such as reirradiation of previously treated patients with recurrent disease or unique
anatomical situations where IMRT facilitates the delivery of recommended target volume doses while respecting accepted normal tissue
dose-volume constraints.
• Consider SBRT for patients with oligometastatic disease.
• Image-guided RT (IGRT) with kilovoltage (kV) imaging or cone-beam CT imaging should be routinely used during the course of treatment
with IMRT and SBRT.
• Arterially directed catheter therapy, and in particular yttrium-90 microsphere-selective internal radiation, is an option in highly selected
patients with chemotherapy-resistant/-refractory disease and with predominant hepatic metastases.
• IORT, if available, may be considered for patients with T4 or recurrent cancers as an additional boost.
• Target Volumes
RT fields should include the tumor bed, which should be defined by preoperative radiologic imaging and/or surgical clips.
Radiation doses should be: 45–50 Gy in 25–28 fractions.
◊ Consider boost for close or positive margins or unresectable cases after evaluating the cumulative dose to adjacent organs at risk.
◊ Small bowel dose should be limited to 50 Gy, V45 Gy should be <195 cc for a bowel bag avoidance, or V15 should be <120 cc for
individual small bowel loops, if possible.
◊ Appropriate organs at risk should be evaluated on the dose-volume histogram (DVH).
◊ Fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy should be delivered concurrently with radiation.
• Consider radiation treatment for T4 with penetration to a fixed structure after surgery.
a Bolus 5-FU/leucovorin/RT is an option for patients not able to tolerate capecitabine or infusional 5-FU.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION AND CHEMORADIATION THERAPY
Supportive Care
• Patients should be considered for vaginal dilators and instructed on the symptoms of vaginal stenosis, if applicable.
• Patients of childbearing potential should be counseled about the effects of premature menopause and consideration should be given to referral for
discussion of hormone replacement strategies.
• Patients of childbearing potential should be counseled that an irradiated uterus cannot carry a fetus to term.
• Patients should be counseled on sexual dysfunction, potential for future low testosterone levels, and infertility risks and given information
regarding sperm banking or oocyte, egg, or ovarian tissue banking, as appropriate, prior to treatment.

PRINCIPLES OF RISK ASSESSMENT FOR STAGE II DISEASE1,2,3
• Patient/physician discussion should take place regarding the potential risks of therapy compared to potential benefits, including prognosis.
This should include discussion of evidence supporting treatment, assumptions of benefit from indirect evidence, morbidity associated with
treatment, high-risk characteristics, and patient preferences.
• When determining if adjuvant therapy should be administered, the following should be taken into consideration:
Number of lymph nodes analyzed after surgery (<12)
Poor prognostic features (eg, poorly differentiated histology [exclusive of those that are MSI-H]; lymphatic/vascular invasion; bowel
obstruction; PNI; localized perforation; close, indeterminate, or positive margins; or high tumor budding)
Assessment of other comorbidities and anticipated life expectancy.
• The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy does not improve survival by more than 5%.
• MSI or MMR testing (COL-B 4 of 10)

PRINCIPLES OF ADJUVANT THERAPY
• CAPEOX or FOLFOX is superior to 5-FU/leucovorin for patients with stage III colon cancer.1,2
• Capecitabine appears to be equivalent to bolus 5-FU/leucovorin in patients with stage III colon cancer.3
• A survival benefit has not been demonstrated for the addition of oxaliplatin to 5-FU/leucovorin in stage II colon cancer.4 FOLFOX is
reasonable for patients with stage II colon cancer with multiple high-risk factors and is not indicated for patients with good- or average-risk
stage II colon cancer.
• A benefit for the addition of oxaliplatin to 5-FU/leucovorin in patients aged ≥70 years has not been proven.4
• While non-inferiority of 3 versus 6 months of CAPEOX has not been proven, 3 months of CAPEOX numerically appeared similar to 6 months
of CAPEOX for 5-year overall survival (82.1% vs. 81.2%; HR, 0.96), with considerably less toxicity.5 These results support the use of 3
months of adjuvant CAPEOX over 6 months of adjuvant CAPEOX in the vast majority of patients with stage III colon cancer. In patients with
colon cancer, staged as T1–3, N1 (low-risk stage III), 3 months of CAPEOX is non-inferior to 6 months of CAPEOX for DFS; non-inferiority
of 3 versus 6 months of FOLFOX has not been proven. In patients with colon cancer staged as T4, N1–2 or T any, N2 (high-risk stage III),
3 months of FOLFOX is inferior to 6 months of FOLFOX for DFS, whereas non-inferiority of 3 versus 6 months of CAPEOX has not been
proven. Grade 3+ neurotoxicity rates are lower for patients who receive 3 versus 6 months of treatment (3% vs. 16% for FOLFOX; 3% vs. 9%
for CAPEOX).6
• A pooled analysis of patients with high-risk stage II disease in the IDEA collaboration did not show non-inferiority of 3 months compared
to 6 months of adjuvant treatment. Similar to stage III, the duration of therapy was associated with a small (and not statistically significant)
difference in DFS between 3 and 6 months of CAPEOX. There were significantly fewer grade 3–5 toxicities with 3 versus 6 months.7

c The majority of safety and efficacy data for this regimen have been developed in Europe, where a capecitabine starting dose of 1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days,
repeated every 21 days, is standard. Evidence suggests that North American patients may experience greater toxicity with capecitabine (as well as with other
fluoropyrimidines) than European patients, and may require a lower dose of capecitabine.

PRINCIPLES OF APPENDICEAL ADENOCARCINOMA
Pathologic and Molecular Classification
• Careful pathologic definition is key.1
Infiltrative invasion is the hallmark of appendiceal adenocarcinoma (AA) and is distinct from the pushing invasion of low-grade appendiceal
mucinous neoplasms (LAMN) and high-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (HAMN). HAMN is a very rare diagnosis and should be
labeled only by expert pathologic review as the clinical behavior is more similar to LAMN, but may be misclassified as adenocarcinoma.
AA is more aggressive than neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and mixed NET-adenocarcinoma.
• Mucinous (including goblet cell, a mixed adenocarcinoma-neuroendocrine [MANEC] histology) and non-mucinous adenocarcinomas are
seen, which can be further classified as well-, moderate-, and poorly differentiated.
Non-mucinous AA behaves similarly to colon adenocarcinoma.
Signet ring mucinous adenocarcinoma is associated with a very poor prognosis.
• Discordance in histology may be seen between the appendiceal primary and peritoneal metastases. Survival is most closely associated with
the peritoneal pathologic grade.2
• The molecular workup should mirror CRC. KRAS mutations are common, especially in non-mucinous adenocarcinoma. MSI is rare.3,4
Clinical Presentation
• AA may present incidentally and be diagnosed after an episode of acute appendicitis.
Patients whose appendicitis is managed nonoperatively should be followed closely to avoid a missed diagnosis of an occult malignancy.5,6
Recommend repeat CT scan within 6 months of the episode of appendicitis to ensure resolution of imaging findings.
• Initial presentation may be confused with primary right-sided colon or ovarian/gynecologic cancer.
• A screening colonoscopy should be considered in all patients diagnosed with AA.
A primary lesion may not be visualized by colonoscopy depending on the location of the tumor within the appendix.
A negative colonoscopy in a person with a suggestive history (eg, appendiceal neoplasm, peritoneal carcinomatosis) does not necessarily
rule out an appendiceal cancer.
• Non-specific abdominal bloating, distention, or post-prandial discomfort may be observed with mucinous peritoneal involvement.
• CEA and CA 19-9 should be evaluated and abnormal measurements trended.7
CA-125 could be considered, especially if CEA and CA 19-9 are normal.

M1a Metastasis to one site or organ is identified without peritoneal
metastasis
M1b Metastasis to two or more sites or organs is identified without
peritoneal metastasis
M1c Metastasis to the peritoneal surface is identified alone or with
other site or organ metastases
* Direct invasion in T4 includes invasion of other organs or other segments of the colorectum as a result of direct extension through the serosa, as confirmed on
microscopic examination (for example, invasion of the sigmoid colon by a carcinoma of the cecum) or, for cancers in a retroperitoneal or subperitoneal location, direct
invasion of other organs or structures by virtue of extension beyond the muscularis propria (i.e., respectively, a tumor on the posterior wall of the descending colon
invading the left kidney or lateral abdominal wall; or a mid or distal rectal cancer with invasion of prostate, seminal vesicles, cervix, or vagina).
** Tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures, grossly, is classified cT4b. However, if no tumor is present in the adhesion, microscopically, the classification
should be pT1-4a depending on the anatomical depth of wall invasion. The V and L classification should be used to identify the presence or absence of vascular or
lymphatic invasion whereas the PN prognostic factor should be used for perineural invasion.
