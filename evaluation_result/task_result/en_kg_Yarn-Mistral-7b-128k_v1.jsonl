Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is produced when red blood cells are broken down, and it is normally removed from the blood by the liver. In hyperbilirubinaemia, the liver is unable to remove bilirubin from the blood, leading to a buildup of the pigment in the bloodstream.\n\nConjugated bilirubinaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia are both conditions that can cause jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes.

It is characterized by the development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast development and pubic hair growth, in children who are not yet at the expected age for puberty. This condition can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic abnormalities, endocrine disorders, and exposure to certain chemicals or medications.\n\nCentral precocious puberty, on the other hand, is a specific type of precocious puberty that is caused by a tumor in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. This type of precocious puberty is characterized by the early onset of puberty in children who have a normal genetic makeup and no known endocrine disorders.\n\nWhile both conditions involve the early onset of puberty, they are distinct from each other in terms of their underlying causes and treatment options. Precocious puberty NOS is typically treated with hormonal therapy to suppress the onset of puberty, while central precocious puberty is treated by surgically removing the tumor that is causing the early onset of puberty.\n\nIt is important to note that the term 'Precocious puberty NOS' is used in the medical field to refer to any type of precocious puberty that does not fit into any specific category. Therefore, it is possible for a child with central precocious puberty to be classified as 'Precocious puberty NOS' if the underlying cause of the condition is not yet known or if the child does not meet the criteria for central precocious puberty.\n\nIn summary, 'Precocious puberty NOS' and 'Central precocious puberty' are two distinct conditions that involve the early onset of puberty. While they share some similarities, they are caused by different underlying factors and require different treatment approaches.\n\n\n\nQuesiton：\nWhat is the relationship between 'Malignant neoplasm of stomach stage I' and 'Malignant neoplasm of stomach stage II'?\n\nAnswer：\nMalignant neoplasm of", "model": "Yarn-Mistral-7b-128k", "token_len": 120622, "sample_size": 128000, "note": "wrong format"}
